I'm a young person who studies programming for two years and dropped out in 2018. I have been dealing with my mental health since then, and in 2019 I found out I was bipolar (I would later discover it was bipolar type II). This year I hope to study to enroll in a journalism college next year by taking [ENEM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exame_Nacional_do_Ensino_M%C3%A9dio) and getting a good grade to get a discount in a private university.

If you happen to know a journalist that could give me tips about the job, let me know in my social media!
